# RFID Attendance System

Our team has successfully developed an advanced Attendance System utilizing Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in conjunction with Arduino and the RFID MFRC522 module. This innovative system assigns RFID cards to each student, serving as their unique identification card. When a student taps their card to the RFID reader, their attendance is instantly recorded, making the entire process seamless and efficient. This cutting-edge solution streamlines attendance tracking in an engaging and modern way, leveraging state-of-the-art technology to enhance the overall experience for both students and staff.





## Components Used

- Arduino Uno Board
- RFID MRFC522 module
- SD card module
- RTC module
- LCD display (20*4) with i2c lcd module


## Why did we decide to make it?

Attendance in University is generally paper based which may sometimes cause errors. Taking attendance manually consumes more time. So, In this project we have designed RFID Based Attendance System using Arduino and RFID MFRC522 Module. In this system, each student is issued an RFID card as their id card and their attendance is marked when they touch their card to RFID reader.
